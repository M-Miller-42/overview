# Project Overview
Since some of my projects are not visible on GitHub, this list provides an overview of repositories in which I am substantially involved.


## [Daily Lichess Activity Heatmap](https://github.com/M-Miller-42/lichessActivity)

A simple calendar chart visualizing how many games of chess a user played per day on Lichess.org

**Plain JS, SCSS**


## [iconet Extension for Mastodon](https://codeberg.org/iconet-Foundation/mastodon)
Mastodon is a micro blogging service that supports ActivityPub.
As a proof-of-concept, we added iconet-specific metadata to status objects.
This fork can receive ActivityPub-formatted objects with iconet metadata and utilize it to render a fallback presentation.

This bridge allows communication between ActivityPub instances and servers implementing the iconet packet transport.

**Laravel, PHP, MySQL**


## [iconet Website](https://iconet-foundation.org)
Information page about the iconet foundation. Everything is self-hosted and works with and without Javascript.
